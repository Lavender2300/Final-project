        <section>Swedish Massage <br>
           <p> 60 minutes: $70 | 30 minutes: $50<br>
            Swedish Massage is a very relaxing and therapeutic style of bodywork. It combines oils or lotion with an array of strokes such as rolling, kneading, and percussion to help the body improve its circulation. The benefits of this type of bodywork are wide-ranging and include relief from aches and pains, decreased stress levels in the body, enhanced mental clarity, and greater flexibility.

            <p>Shiatsu<br>
                60 minutes: $80 | 30 minutes: $60<br>
                Shiatsu is a Japanese form of massage therapy. The word Shiatsu comes from two Japanese words - "shi" (finger) and "atsu" (pressure). In addition to the direct stimulation of pressure points along the energy pathways of your body, gentle stretching techniques are applied over a wider area of the body to integrate the point work and encourage the flow of Chi (energy) throughout the body. Shiatsu is a type of work that is done on a matt and the client is fully clothed.
